Assignment 1

A Response to the Following Prompt:

Adapted from Ricardo Dominguez when we asked for an
exercise he facilitates in his classes:

A) Leave all your technology at home including paper and
pencils. Wander around campus, or you neighborhood, or a
mall etc., and feel every type of learning that you
encounter.

a) Directions. (A question of navigation).

b) Laws. (A question of trespass and blockage).

c) Somatic. (A question of learned bodies: dress,
style, and beyond)

d) Invisible. (Learning that is atmospheric but
unwritten or un-learning as learning.)

B) Go to your favorite coffee place or public space with
your computer and open your favorite learning
environment and and have someone blindfold you (NO
peeking):

a) Now wander the above "learning" as an
affective zone (not effective zone); craft
(write/assemble etc.) the feeling of your
wandering and NOT a representation of your
“wandering”. What does learning in your life feel
like?

(Like Luke Skywalker "Feel the Force" :-).

P.S. The above can also be done naked--this allows you
to feel even more than you normally do.

C) Bring craft (B/a) to class next week
