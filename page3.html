	<p>The prompt further emphasizes the importance of “wandering” in the process of learning. This is clearly a reference to and a 
		pun on the name of the rhetorical critic Philip Wander,* whose work (fuelled by Materialist vigor) nearly polemically 
		underscores the necessity of critical socio-political engagement in scholarly endeavors and criticizes the academic who 
		refrains from such engagement. Learning is/feels political. Teaching is/feels political. Writing is/feels political.** 
		Grad workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your likely exploitative and, quite frankly, confusingly 
		articulated contracts!</p>
	<p>*And not at all a reference to and pun on the name of pedagogy and composition scholar Neal Learner. That would be ridiculous.</p>
	<p>**Coding is also political. But that’s for a later dissertation.</p>
